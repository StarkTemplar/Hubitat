<strong>PowerView Inverter</strong><br>
<br>SunSynk and SolArk Solar inverters use the MySolark app for reporting and monitoring. This driver allows you to set a refresh schedule to pull the MySolark API. It maintains the current Inverter states as a device in Hubitat. These are based on Power production and energy flow, grid usage, battery charge, and grid presence. They can be used to trigger other automations like alerting when the grid goes down or when your battery SOC is too low.
<br>There are also 2 output tiles to make for easier dashboard creation.
