<strong>PowerView Inverter</strong><br>
<br>SunSynk and SolArk Solar inverters use PowerView app for reporting and monitoring. This driver allows you to set a refresh schedule to pull the PowerView API. It maintains the current Inverter states as a device in Hubitat. These are based on Power production and energy flow, grid usage, and Battery charge. They can be used to trigger other automations.
