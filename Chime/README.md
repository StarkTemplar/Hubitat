<strong>Door Chime</strong> 
<br><i>(fork of the <a href="https://github.com/djdizzyd/hubitat/tree/master/Apps/simple-doorchime">original Brian Copeland build</a>)</i><br>
<br>This App is a fork of the original Brian Copeland build, that simply makes a chime or beep, or Speech request when a door on the list opens. I fixed issues added functionality to interact and test your chime devices, and to block chimes during selected Hub modes, or HSM Status. You can install multiple instances for different chime rules.
