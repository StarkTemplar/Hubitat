# Hubitat

I've built these functional applications/device drivers and use them heavily, because I want my Hubitat automations to be integrated intelligently into my smart home. Since these apps and drivers haven't been ported to Hubitat previously, I decided to build them for myself. I share with the community to save anyone else the trouble. 

1. Solar: PowerView Inverter
   
2. Irrigation: Degree Days Timer

3. Chime: Door Chime (fork of the original Brian Copeland build)

4. Windows: Laptop Battery Driver

Coming Soon:

5. Camera: Reolink IP Camera Driver

6. HVAC: Smarter HVAC Manager (for two story homes)
