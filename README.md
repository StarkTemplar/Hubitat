<br><strong>1.<font size="+2">Solar:</font> PowerView Inverter</strong><br>
<br>SunSynk and SolArk Solar inverters use PowerView app for reporting and monitoring. This driver allows you to set a refresh schedule to pull the PowerView API. It maintains the current Inverter states as a device in Hubitat. These are based on Power production and energy flow, grid usage, and battery charge. The device can be used to trigger other automations.
